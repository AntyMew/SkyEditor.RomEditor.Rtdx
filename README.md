# SkyEditor.RomEditor.Rtdx

A work-in-progress ROM editor for Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX.

## Building

This is in the early stages of development, so you'll need to import the [skyeditor NuGet feed](https://dev.azure.com/project-pokemon/Sky%20Editor/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=skyeditor%40Local):
```

```

## Usage

This doesn't yet do anything the average user will care about. SkyEditor.RomEditor.Rtdx.ConsoleApp can be used as a manual test harness if you have the a decrypted and extracted ROM already available.
